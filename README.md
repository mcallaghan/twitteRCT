# twitteRCT

This repository contains data and analysis of a project to conduct a randomised control trial using Twitter. We send thousands of tweets containing judgements from politifact.org about statements that Trump made to Twitter users who have liked tweets created by Donald Trump.

We observe whether this new information about Donald Trump changes the way users interact with the candidate on Twitter by comparing the frequency of likes and retweets of Trump's posts in treatment and control groups.

The experiment is ongoing but some (very) preliminary results are available [here](https://github.com/mcallaghan/twitteRCT/blob/master/results/preliminary_results.pdf)

The experiment is run from a Raspberry Pi: pi-side code has not yet been made publicly available, but a summary of the steps taken is available [here](https://github.com/mcallaghan/twitteRCT/blob/master/log.md)
